# Refactor Safety

- Before any structural refactor on a file over 300 LOC, first remove all dead code (unused imports, exports, props, debug logs) and commit the cleanup separately.
- Split multi-file refactors into phases of 5 files or fewer. Complete each phase, run verification, and wait for explicit user approval before proceeding to the next.
- Never report a task as complete until the project's type-checker and linter pass with zero errors. If none are configured, state that explicitly.
- When renaming any function, type, or variable, search separately for: direct calls, type-level references, string literals containing the name, dynamic imports/require(), re-exports and barrel files, and test files/mocks.
